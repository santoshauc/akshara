# SchoolErp — Project Status & Session Handoff

> Purpose: lets any development session (human or AI) resume this build with
> zero conversation history. Keep this file updated at the end of every
> working session.

## What this is

Multi-tenant School Management SaaS for Indian schools.
Stack: .NET 8 Clean Architecture + CQRS (MediatR) + EF Core 8 + PostgreSQL 16,
Blazor WASM admin portal (MudBlazor), React Native (Expo + TypeScript) parent app.
Monorepo layout is described in `README.md`.

## Completed (all with tests + browser-verified where UI exists)

| Vertical | Backend | API | Portal UI | Parent app |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multi-tenancy (EF filters + PostgreSQL RLS) | ✅ | — | — | — |
| Auth: JWT + rotating refresh (reuse-detect), OTP, permission policies, lockout | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ login | ✅ OTP login |
| Tenant catalog/onboarding (Super Admin) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | — |
| SIS: years, classes/sections, students, guardians, enrollments | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (children) |
| Attendance + absence SMS via outbox | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ grid | ✅ card |
| Examinations: subjects, papers, marks, publish + SMS, results w/ rank | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ card |
| Fees: heads, plans, receipts + SMS, gateway abstraction + HMAC webhook | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ card |
| Parent API (family-scoped guard, 404-not-403) | ✅ | ✅ | — | ✅ |
| Notices + Homework (class/section visibility) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ cards |

Test suite: 33 unit + 44 integration = **77 green** (`dotnet test` from `school-erp/`).
Integration tests use Testcontainers (needs Docker running).

## Remaining scope (in rough priority order)

1. Transport trips/GPS + React Native driver app (base transport —
   vehicles/routes/stops/allocation, portal UI, parent card — is DONE and
   E2E-verified, commits 59c43d9 + 013af23; 81 tests green).
2. Timetable module.
3. Auth hardening (task list #7): device registration, MFA, persistent
   audit-log trail, dev-seeder claim backfill (see Gotchas).
4. Hangfire hosting for jobs (outbox dispatcher currently a BackgroundService).
5. Real Razorpay adapter for `IPaymentGateway` (dev HMAC gateway in place).
6. CI/CD (GitHub Actions), Dockerfile for API, docs pack (architecture, API
   guide, user manuals), localization resources (en/te), report-card PDFs.

## How to run (Windows dev box)

- `dotnet` is at `C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe` (may not be on PATH in
  shells); `dotnet-ef` via `%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools`.
- Local stack: `docker compose -f deployment/docker-compose.yml up -d`
  (PostgreSQL 16 on 5432 + Redis; init script creates the NON-superuser
  runtime role `schoolerp_app` — the API must use it or RLS is silently inert).
- Migrations (run as owner role):
  `dotnet-ef database update --project backend/src/SchoolErp.Infrastructure --startup-project backend/src/SchoolErp.Api --connection "Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=schoolerp;Username=schoolerp;Password=schoolerp_dev_only"`
- Dev servers are defined in `<workspace>/.claude/launch.json`:
  `api` (http://localhost:5199), `portal` (http://localhost:5050),
  `parent` (Expo web, http://localhost:8081).
- Parent app type-check: `npx tsc --noEmit` in `mobile/parent-app`.

## Dev credentials (Development seeder + manual rows)

- Super Admin (platform): empty school code + `superadmin@schoolerp.local` / `ChangeMe@12345`
- School admin: `DEMO01` + `admin@demo.school` / `ChangeMe@12345`
- Parent (OTP): school `DEMO01`, phone `+919876501234` (Priya Reddy — guardian
  of demo student Ananya Reddy, Grade 5 A). OTP code appears in API log as
  `[DEV SMS]`.

## Conventions (follow these when adding modules)

- Every business entity extends `TenantEntity`; every migration creating a
  tenant table MUST call `migrationBuilder.EnableTenantRls("table")` (and
  `DisableTenantRls` in Down). Platform-scoped exceptions (documented in each
  entity): `outbox_messages`, `payment_orders`, `refresh_tokens`, `otp_codes`.
- Module pattern: Domain entity → EF config (`Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations`)
  → DbSet on `IApplicationDbContext` + `AppDbContext` → CQRS command/query with
  FluentValidation validator → controller with `[HasPermission(...)]` →
  integration tests (copy an existing module fixture) → portal page → parent
  endpoint/card if parent-facing.
- New permissions go in `Shared/Authorization/Permissions.cs`. GOTCHA: seeded
  roles hold permission claims copied at seed time — adding a permission later
  requires a claims backfill for existing roles (bit us with `homework.*`).
- Side effects (SMS/push) go through the transactional outbox
  (`OutboxMessage` + `SmsPayload`), written in the same SaveChanges as the
  business change. Dispatcher: `OutboxDispatcherService` (API host).
- Package pins are deliberate (OSS licensing): MediatR 12.x, AutoMapper 13.x,
  FluentAssertions 6.x. AutoMapper 13.0.1 has a known advisory — accepted and
  documented in `docs/security-notes.md`; plan is to swap to Mapster pre-GA.
- Zero-warning policy: builds must be clean (analyzers on). Test naming with
  underscores is allowed via `backend/tests/Directory.Build.props`.

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- STOP the dev servers (preview `api`/`portal`) before `dotnet build` —
  running processes lock the DLLs (MSB3027).
- PostgreSQL superusers bypass RLS: runtime connection must be `schoolerp_app`.
- Identity tables: PascalCase table names, snake_case columns.
- MVC validation attributes on records must target constructor parameters,
  not `[property: ...]`.
- Razor: never name a loop variable `section` (collides with `@section`).
- EF can't translate ordering by projected record properties — order before
  `.Select`. `jsonb` columns have no LIKE operator.
- Expo web is the fast way to browser-verify the parent app; API CORS must
  include `http://localhost:8081`.
- The portal is a PWA: after rebuilding it, the service worker can serve a
  STALE cached bundle (new routes 404 / odd auth behavior). Fix in the browser:
  unregister service workers + clear CacheStorage, then reload.
- In Blazor login flows, never hard-navigate right after submitting — it can
  kill the async token write to localStorage; let the SPA navigate itself.
